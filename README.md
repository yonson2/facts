Tiny little backend for a small toy site built with Go & Buffalo

## Starting the Application

Buffalo ships with a command that will watch your application and automatically rebuild the Go binary and any assets for you. To do that run the "buffalo dev" command:

```console
buffalo dev
```

If you point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) you should see a "Welcome to Buffalo!" page.

**Congratulations!** You now have your Buffalo application up and running.
